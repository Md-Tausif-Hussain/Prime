Prime Number Checker<br>                                      
• This is a simple Python script to determine whether a number entered by the user is a prime number.                                     

Description                                          
• A prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.                                                         

This script:                                                   
• Takes an integer input from the user.                                        
• Checks if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself.                               
• Prints Prime if the number is prime, otherwise prints Not Prime.                                 

How to Use                                     
• Run the script in a Python environment.                                
• Enter a number when prompted.                                           
• View the result indicating whether it is a prime number or not.
